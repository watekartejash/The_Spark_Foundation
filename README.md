# The_Spark_Foundation

This repository contains the tasks that I completed while working as an intern for The Sparks Foundation.

Internship Category - Data Science and Business 

Internship Duration - 1 Month ( September-2023 )

Internship Type - Work from Home

In this internship, we were provided a total of 8 Tasks and I was able to successfully complete all the 4 tasks within the given time-frame.


# Task 1 ( Prediction Using supervised ML )

=> Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

=> You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool

=> Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data

=> What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

# Task 2 ( Prediction using Unsupervised ML )

=> From the qiven 'lris' dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

=> Use R or Python or perform this task

=> Dataset: https://bit.ly/3kXTdoxI

# Task 4 ( Exploratory Data Analysis-Terrorism )

=> Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’

=> As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism.

=> What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?

=> By Using Microsoft Power BI

# Task 6 ( Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm )

=> For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

=> The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
